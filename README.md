Apriori_based_Anonymization
===========================
This repository is an python implement of Apriori_based_Anonymization. 

Apriori_based_Anonymization is a counting tree based data anonymization algorithm for set-valued dataset, proposed by Manolis Terrovitis in his papers[1-2]. Although he gave the pseudocode in his papers, the source code(C++ implement) is not available. So I implement this algorithm in python for further study.
